<h1>Heaps</h1>
<p>Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children.</p>

<h1>Types of Heaps</h1>
<h1>Max Heap</h1>
<p>In this heap, the value of the root node must be the greatest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right subtree also.
</p>

<h1>Min Heap</h1>
<p>In this heap, the value of the root node must be the smallest among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right subtree also.</p>
